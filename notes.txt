jsx is very similar structure to html but with super powers 

jsx just look like html but it's not html

the super power is that we're not able to do any calculations or operations in html like addition
and logical ones but here in jsx by placing the things within {} we can perfom any operations 

component is nothing but a single piece which you'll repeat with different different component

in any programming language you can't return more than one thing, so if you want to return 
multiple items place them within a div and return it 

code snippets

function App(){
  let values=["Manoj","Ketaki","Vaishnavi"];
  return(
    values.map((value,index)=>(
      <div key={index} className="w-fit h-10 bg-zinc-300 mb-5">{value}</div>
    ))
  )
}
export default App;
//this is called as functional component
// no need of writing everything just type rfc

1. props are used to make our components responsive
2. suppose that you have a button and you want to use that button in multiple places
3. instead of making it hardcoded send it's data from that parent component
4. and then use it by child component
5. our data will be in our main app component 
6. and with the help of props we send those data into our component classes


//react styling components

1. use css modules
2. use tailwind css
